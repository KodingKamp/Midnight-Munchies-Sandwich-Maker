<h2>GUI Design Principles</h3>
Adhering to the GUI Design Principles, this program groups buttons into container menus to aesthetically please the user and directs their focus to important elements in the scene. The visual elements of every button interaction such as its displayed text and effects provide the user with clarity with the functionality of that button. The program has a simplistic layout and design that allows the user to easily predict and understand the functionality of the elements of each scene. The user would be able to learn what to do and how to do it with the help of visual queues and pop-up alerts to aid in the use of the program. Each scene shares the same characteristics maintaining a consistency amoung the elements in the scenes. The user has full control as all the functionality rely on the interaction between the user and the buttons on screen. Alerts inform users of their actions and adds a level of forgiveness if the user interacts with certain buttons out of curiousity or by mistake. Having taken common material from the real world, this program brings familiarity to the users and they are able to relate to the elements.
